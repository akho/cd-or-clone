# `cd-or-clone`

If you work on several computers, you can sometimes forget which Git repos you have locally, or where.
So you try to cd to a folder you just know has to be there, 
and it’s not there, 
and you need to remember where the Git origin is so you can `git clone`,
and then you `git clone`,
and then you remember it was in a different subfolder on your other computer
(because you’re so _organized_),
but you keep it as it is because why bother, 
and then everything is in different places everywhere,
and you are miserable.

Of course, where I said “you” in the paragraph above, I actually meant me.

So.

`cd-or-clone` remembers where things are.
If you set it up as a hook in Zsh, it will record local locations ang origins of all repos you work with,
and then allow you to quickly retrieve them.

The default location of the store is `~/.local/cd-or-clone.store`, though you can set a different one in `$CD_OR_CLONE_STORE` environment variable.
I recommend you make the store a part of your dotfiles repo, or sync it somehow else.
In your `.zshrc` you put

    eval $(cd-or-clone zsh)

That sets up a cd hook, which will record all your repos and origins in the store as you go.
To go somewhere, press `Ctrl-G`. It will put you in a Fzf with all the folders cd-or-clone remembers.
When you choose one, you’ll either be magically transported there (via `cd`),
or, if the folder sadly does not exist,
cd-or-clone will `git clone` it from the origin it recorded.

If you are not on Zsh, run cd-or-clone to see the options.

## Installation

You need to have a recent Perl installed.
You probably do.
I recommend also having Fzf in your path, and Zsh provides the easiest experience.

If you have Nix,

    nix-env -i -f .

installs the script (but not Zsh or Fzf).

    eval $(cd-or-clone zsh)

Sets up Zsh hooks and the `Ctrl-G` keybinding.
You can also run `cd-or-clone zsh` to see what it does and modify to taste.
